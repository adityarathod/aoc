# Advent of Code (AoC)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual advent calendar of coding challenges that increase in difficulty as the month of December progresses. These are my solutions to these problems, categorized by year, along with the associated inputs.

My 2020 solutions are in Python and are cleaned-up versions of the programs used to submit to the leaderboard.

## Running a Particular Solution

When in the project's root directory:

```bash
python 2020/dayN.py # where N is the day to run
```

You can run on custom input by replacing `dayN.txt` with another input of identical format.
